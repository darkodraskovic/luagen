# luagen

**luagen** is a lightweight lua framework based on [love2d](https://love2d.org) used for generative art and game development.

**luagen** uses:
- [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump), LÖVE Helper Utilities for Massive Progression
- [HC](https://github.com/vrld/HC), a "general purpose collision detection library for the use with LÖVE"
- [love-loader](https://github.com/kikito/love-loader), a "threaded resource loading for LÖVE"
    
The **luagen** architecture is based on parent-child tree and component-entity system.
